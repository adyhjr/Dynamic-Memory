# Dynamic-Memory

For this program, there are 3 test cases used to calculate the total resistance of circuits using object-oriented programming. In code, there emphasis on inheritance using a virtual class and also the use of destructors that deallocates memory. There are no inputs taken from the user but there are several illustrations within the project that represent circuits where the values are used for inputs. For outputs, using methods within the subclasses, the total resistance for each test case it printed.
